                        <p>The origins of chess can be traced back to ancient India, where it was known as chaturanga. The game spread to Persia and then to the Arab world before reaching Europe during the Middle Ages. Over time, the game evolved into its current form, with the modern rules being standardized in the 19th century.</p>

                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            <p>The game is played by two players, each controlling 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means placing their king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.</p>
                            <h3>Moving The Pieces</h3>
                            <p>Each piece has its own unique way of moving across the board. The king moves one square in any direction, while the queen can move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically across any number of squares. Rooks move horizontally or vertically across any number of squares, knights move in an L-shape, and bishops move diagonally across any number of squares.There are various rules and regulations governing the game, such as castling, en passant, and stalemate.</p>
                            <h3>Pawn Play</h3>
                            <p>Pawns move forward one or two squares on their first move and then one square forward on subsequent moves, except when capturing an opponent's piece, which is done by moving one square diagonally. Pawns can also be promoted to a more powerful piece if they reach the opposite end of the board.</p>
                            <h3>Scoring</h3>
                            <p> Stalemate is a situation where a player is not in check, but they have no legal moves available, resulting in a draw. Checkmating the oppenent is the main way to win the game. Or you can resign and give the oppenent the win.</p>
