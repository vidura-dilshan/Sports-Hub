                        <p>Ice hockey, sometimes known as hockey, is a team sport played on ice skates, typically on a rink with lines and markings designed specifically for the activity. It belongs to the hockey family of sports. Ice hockey is a sport where two opposing teams control, move, and shoot a closed, vulcanized rubber disc known as a "puck" into the other team's goal.</p>
                        <p>The value of each goal is one point. The winning team is determined by how many goals they score. With the exception of penalties, each team in a formal game has six skaters on the ice at once, one of whom is the goaltender. As a full-contact sport, ice hockey is regarded as one of the more physically taxing sports.</p>
                        <p>The first indoor game of ice hockey was played on March 3, 1875, in Montreal, which is considered to be the birthplace of the current game. The length of the ice rink and the use of a puck are two elements of the game that have persisted to this day.</p>

                        <p>Ice hockey is thought to have developed from simple stick and ball sports, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty, practiced in the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, Ireland, and other countries. Lacrosse, an American sport, had a significant impact. Early versions of an organized sport that is now known as bandy, a sport that is distinct from ice hockey, were arguably the games that had the biggest influence on the early design of ice hockey.</p>
                        <p>were introduced to North America, where they led to the development of a number of closely related winter sports with informal rules, including shinny and ice polo. These sports, however, would subsequently be incorporated into a new organized sport with formalized rules, which is now known as ice hockey.</p>
                        <p>Bandy, a game with roots in the Medieval Ages, was the precursor to ice hockey. Like to nearly all other games, bandy developed into its contemporary form in England during the 19th century, specifically in the Fen district on the East coast.</p>
                        <p>The term "hockey" first appeared in print in England and has typically been used to refer to field hockey. The word "hockey" was first recorded in print in Richard Johnson's (1772) book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Containing a Novel Method of Infant Teaching, chapter XI, "New Additions on the Game of Hockey."</p>
                        <p>Stick-and-ball games have been played in Iran since before Christianity. A lot of team games, including ice hockey, have similarities to the game of polo. In fact, it's likely that hockey got its core concept from polo. [Reference needed] These sports were played in Europe and included variations of field hockey, the closely related Scottish sport of shinty, and the Irish game of hurling (including bandy ball, played in England). Between the Middle Ages and the Dutch Golden Period, the Low Countries were populated by players of IJscolf, a game that resembled colf on an ice-covered surface.</p>

                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            <p>The goal of hockey is to outscore the opposition by a certain number of goals. The puck may not be intentionally kicked or directed into the goal with any part of the player's body. Each side employs five skaters—three forwards, two defensemen, and a goaltender—during regulation time.</p>
                            <h3>Playing Area</h3>
                            <p>A typical NHL rink measures 200 feet (61 meters) long by 85 feet (26 meters) broad and is designed like a round-cornered rectangle. International rinks are normally 200 feet by 100 feet, while college rinks in the US are often 184 to 200 feet by 85 to 98 feet.(<em>See Left Image</em>)</p>
                            <h3>Starting Play</h3>
                            <p>The game starts in the centre circle with a face off. The puck is dropped by the official between two opponents, who subsequently compete to gain advantage for their team. The use of a faceoff to restart play following a halt in any of the defending or attacking face off zones is also permitted.</p>
                            <h3>Scoring</h3>
                            <p>A player receives a point for each goal they score or assist on. Total points are calculated as the sum of all goals and assists. The National Hockey League (NHL) player who accumulates the most points at the conclusion of the regular season is given the Art Ross Trophy.</p>
                            <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
                            <p>The fundamental skills involved in the game, include:</p>
                            <ol>

                            </ol>
                            <h3>Game Duration</h3>
                            <p>procedure for competition. Three 20-minute quarters make up a typical game, with a 15-minute break between the first and second periods. For each period, the teams switch ends. A five-minute sudden-victory extra period is played if a medal-round game is tied.</p>
