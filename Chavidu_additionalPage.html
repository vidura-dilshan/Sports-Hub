                        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, usually each with five players, compete against one another on a rectangular court with the main goal of preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop while putting the ball through the defender's hoop.</p>
                        <p>Basketball dates back to 1891, when James Naismith, a physical education professor attempting to keep his gym class active, desired an indoor game to keep his students occupied and maintain proper levels of fitness even during the winter. Basketball was born when he wrote a few basic rules and nailed a peach basket to a 10-foot elevated track.The sport's popularity has increased since its inception, when it was primarily confined to colleges and high schools. There were 17 teams when the National Basketball Association (NBA) was first established; by 2018, that number had more than doubled to 38 thanks to the existence of a professional women's league, the existence of men's and women's teams on many university campuses, and the development of basketball as a significant international sport.</p>

                <div class="history">
                    <div class="leftCol">
                        <p>James Naismith was searching for a fresh activity to keep his pupils entertained while teaching physical education at a local YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. The class couldn't go outside to exercise because of the winter. Naismith had to act quickly since he was at a crossroads and wanted to think up a game that would engage his restless and "disorderly" young men.</p>
                        <p>Naismith was sitting in the gym when he thought back to his early years and recalled playing "duck on a rock" in Canada. The object of the game is to toss little rocks at a big boulder on a wall until it falls. In the gym, rugby players were honing their hand-eye coordination by tossing a ball into a box that was on the floor.</p>
                        <p>Naismith thought he could invent a new sport by elevating the box and utilizing a ball rather than rocks. As he ran out of extra crates, he had to settle for peach baskets as targets and created the first set of basketball regulations in less than an hour. On that day, basketball was created.</p>
                        <p>A soccer ball was used to create basketball. These spherical "association football" balls had a set of laces to cover the opening created when the other sewn-together pieces of the ball's cover were turned inside-out in order to enter the inflating bladder. These laces could make dribbling and bounce passes unpredictable. Later, a technique for making balls without laces was created, and Naismith approved of this modification to the sport.</p>
                        <p>The first basketballs were brown, and Tony Hinkle didn't introduce the orange ball that is currently commonly used until the late 1950s when he was searching for a ball that would be more apparent to players and spectators alike. The original game did not have dribbling, only the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the main way to move the ball. When dribbling was eventually introduced, the early balls' asymmetrical design made it difficult. By 1896, dribbling was common, and in 1898, a rule banning the double dribble was put into effect.</p>

                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            <p>The game is split into two teams. Each team has 5 players on the court at any given time. The goal of the game is to outscore your opponent by shooting the ball into your basket while preventing them from doing the same. The ball can be advanced up the floor using only one's hands, either by dribbling or passing to teammates.</p>
                            <h3>Playing Area</h3>
                            <p>A mid-court line divides the basketball court's rectangular shape in half. Two baskets are present, one at either end of the court. The height of the typical basketball rim is ten feet.(<em>See Left Image</em>)</p>
                            <h3>Starting Play</h3>
                            <p>Each team is given a basket to shoot at during the first half, then at halftime, they trade ends. One member from each team jumps the ball in the center of the court to start the game. Around the center circle, other participants alternately queue up. When a player touches the ball, the game starts. The team with the ball goes on offense and tries to score against the team going defensive.</p>
                            <h3>Scoring</h3>
                            <p>Points are scored any time the ball goes through the basket.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>3 points = shot made beyond the 3-pt line</li>
                                <li>2 points = shot made from anywhere else on the court</li>
                                <li>1 point = free throw</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
                            <p>The fundamental skills involved in the game, include:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Dribbling</li>
                                <li>Passing and Catching</li>
                                <li>Shooting</li>
                                <li>Rebounding</li>

                            </ol>
                            <h3>Game Duration</h3>
                            <p>Games are played throughout intervals of time called periods. The duration and number of periods vary depending on the league. For instance, college women's games are split into four 10-minute quarters, whereas high school games are split into four 8-minute halves. College men's games are split into two 20-minute halves.</p>
